    <h2>Instructions: </h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Toast the Bread:</h2> Toast the slices of bread until they are golden and crispy. You can use a toaster, oven, or stovetop grill for this step.</li>
        <li><h2>Prepare the Avocado:</h2> Cut the avocados in half, remove the pits, and scoop the flesh into a bowl. Mash the avocados with a fork until you achieve your desired consistency. Some prefer it chunky, others smooth.</li>
        <li><h2>Season the Avocado:</h2> Add the lemon juice, salt, and pepper to the mashed avocado. Mix well to combine. The lemon juice not only adds flavor but also helps to prevent the avocado from browning.</li>
        <li><h2>Assemble the Toast:</h2> Spread the seasoned avocado mixture evenly over the toasted bread slices.</li>
        <li><h2>Add Toppings:</h2> Add your preferred toppings to the avocado toast. Some popular options include cherry tomatoes, red pepper flakes, a drizzle of olive oil, a poached egg, microgreens, or crumbled feta cheese.</li>
        <li><h2>Serve:</h2> Serve the avocado toast immediately while the bread is still warm and crispy. Enjoy this simple yet delicious dish!</li>
