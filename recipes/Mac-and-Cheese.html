            <li>4 tablespoons butter</li>

            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon black pepper</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon paprika (optional)</li>

    <h2>Instructions: </h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Cook the Macaroni:</h2> Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Add the macaroni and cook until al dente, according to the package instructions. Drain and set aside.</li>
        <li><h2>Make the Roux:</h2> In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium heat. Once melted, add the flour and whisk constantly for about 2 minutes, until the mixture is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li><h2>Add the Milk:</h2> Gradually add the milk to the roux, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Continue to cook and whisk until the mixture thickens, about 3-5 minutes.</li>
        <li><h2>Add the Cheese:</h2> Remove the saucepan from heat and stir in the shredded cheddar and mozzarella cheeses until completely melted and smooth. Season with salt, black pepper, and paprika, if using.</li>
        <li><h2>Combine with Macaroni:</h2> Add the cooked macaroni to the cheese sauce and stir until well combined and the macaroni is evenly coated with the sauce.</li>
        <li><h2>Optional Baking Step:</h2> Preheat your oven to 375°F (190°C). Transfer the mac and cheese to a baking dish and top with bread crumbs. Bake for about 20 minutes, or until the top is golden and bubbly.</li>
        <li><h2>Serve:</h2> Serve the mac and cheese hot, straight from the saucepan or baking dish. Enjoy the creamy, cheesy goodness!</li>
