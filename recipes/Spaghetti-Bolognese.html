        <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Olive oil, for sautéing</li>
            <li>1 onion, finely chopped</li>
            <li>2 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 carrot, finely chopped</li>
            <li>1 celery stalk, finely chopped</li>
            <li>500g (about 1 lb) ground beef</li>
            <li>1 can (400g) diced tomatoes</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 cup beef or vegetable stock</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried oregano</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon dried basil</li>
            <li>Salt and pepper, to taste</li>
            <li>300g (about 10 oz) spaghetti</li>
            <li>Grated Parmesan cheese, for serving (optional)</li>
        </ul>

    <h2>Instructions: </h2>

    <ol>
        <li><h2>Heat the Olive Oil:</h2> In a large pan, heat a generous amount of olive oil over medium heat. This will be used to sauté the vegetables and add flavor to the dish.</li>
        <li><h2>Sauté the Vegetables:</h2> Add the finely chopped onion, minced garlic, chopped carrot, and celery to the pan. Cook, stirring frequently, until the vegetables are softened and the onion becomes translucent. This step helps to build a rich base for the sauce.</li>
        <li><h2>Brown the Ground Beef:</h2> Increase the heat slightly and add the ground beef to the pan. Cook until the beef is well browned, breaking it up with a spoon as it cooks. This helps to create a hearty texture in the sauce.</li>
        <li><h2>Add Tomatoes and Seasonings:</h2> Stir in the diced tomatoes and tomato paste. Pour in the beef or vegetable stock and add the dried oregano and basil. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Stir everything together and bring the mixture to a simmer.</li>
        <li><h2>Simmer the Sauce:</h2> Reduce the heat to low and let the sauce simmer uncovered for about 30-45 minutes, stirring occasionally. The sauce should thicken and the flavors should meld together. If the sauce becomes too thick, you can add a bit more stock or water.</li>
        <li><h2>Cook the Spaghetti:</h2> While the sauce is simmering, bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Cook the spaghetti according to the package instructions until al dente. Drain the spaghetti and toss with a little olive oil to prevent sticking.</li>
        <li><h2>Serve:</h2> Serve the Bolognese sauce over the cooked spaghetti. Optionally, top with grated Parmesan cheese for an extra layer of flavor.</li>
        </ol>
